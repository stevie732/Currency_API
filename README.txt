This project was an assignment I was given at Coding Temple while I was enrolled. The objective was to build a landing page and connect it to an API of our choice. I chose the bit currency API. This is just a quick and easy landing page. I also have a tutorial on how to build this project from scratch using HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript, and Jquery.
